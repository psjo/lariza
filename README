Background information
----------------------

 What lariza is and what it's not

  lariza does what I need. It won't do other things. I'm open for pull
  requests but please don't be upset if I turn them down -- which might
  happen if it's a feature that I simply don't need.

  Especially, it's very likely that lariza will never have a "follow
  mode" like dwb, luakit or others have. I've used these browsers for
  quite some time and I've also used Firefox extensions that add a
  "follow mode". The point is, "follow mode" doesn't work anymore. This
  was a good thing ten years ago. Today, a lot of websites make heavy
  use of JavaScript or hovering. You NEED some kind of pointing device.
  I found using "follow mode" to be very frustrating today, because you
  still have to reach for the mouse all the time. So, you might as well
  just optimize your mousing workflow.

  lariza does not compete with powerful browsers like dwb or luakit, nor
  with monstrous applications like Firefox or Chromium. lariza won't
  have persistent storage, nor a plugin system, nor cloud sync, nor
  bookmarks.

  lariza tries not to exceed 1000 lines of code.


 About the name

  "lariza" stems from a german sentence:

      Alle anderen waren mir zu anstrengend.
       l   a         r    i  z  a

  That phrase basically means: "It was too tiresome to deal with any
  other browser." I couldn't find a simple browser that does just what I
  need. Most of them are utterly bloated, others lack essential
  functions. Thus, I was forced to write scripts and tools and stuff to
  deal with these issues. That is what was tiresome. I don't want to
  work around bugs or nonsensical behavior anymore.

  So, I wrote my own browser^W WebKit GUI. WebKit does all the dirty
  work.
